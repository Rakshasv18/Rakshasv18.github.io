## ✈️ Travel & Reflections

I believe in growing not just technically, but also through **experience, culture, and inner peace**.

### 🌍 Places I’ve Been
- 🇺🇸 United States – Studying, researching, growing!
- 🇮🇳 India – My roots, my home, my family
- 📍 To be continued…

### 📚 Philosophy I Follow

> *“You have a right to perform your prescribed duties, but you are not entitled to the fruits of your actions.”*  
> — *Bhagavad Gita*

I read spiritual texts and try to stay grounded while aiming for balance in mind, body, and purpose.
